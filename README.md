# Airbnb_data

## Libraries used
Libraies in this project includes numpy, pandas, matplotlibs, seaborn and datetime.

## Motivation for the project
This is a project for the Udacity Data Scienties Nanodegree. The data is from Kaggle Boston Airbnb Open Data (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston). I intend to figure out three questions with the data available:

(1) Possible determinants of housing price;

(2) Housing availability and price trend over months;

(3) Relationship between customer ratings and housing price.

## Files in the repository
Boston_Airbnb.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that contains the code. listings.csv is the original dataset.

## Summary of the results
